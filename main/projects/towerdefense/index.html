        Okay, so, Pacman, is an idiot. He married a ghost. But did you know that ghosts give birth to MILLIONS of babies? Oh and those babies hate their dad. They're going to kill Pacman. Help him and his buddies out to kill MILLIONS of ghost babies.
        Dont feel bad they were a waste of oxygen anyway, and technically you're not killing them - Pacman is. You're just the co-murderer.
